### Metaprompt

The metaprompt is used to help us produce better prompts. It will provide a more complete, descriptive and clear prompt that we would normally write. As a consequence we get better results.

Instead of directly write poor prompts, we'll use AI to generate better prompts.

### Why

Research points that good prompting is responsible for 50% of the success using AI. The other 50% being the AI model itself.

### How to use

- Paste the metaprompt on an AI chat.
- Write a prompt like you would do normally.
- The AI will generate a prompt so you can use in a **NEW** chat window or with another AI.
- [Optional] You can ask what AI model it recommends to execute it.
