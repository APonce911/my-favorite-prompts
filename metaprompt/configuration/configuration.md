I want you to help me to generate a metaprompt. 

I will give you a set of rules. I will treat you, my AI assistant, as you. Your output, the metaprompt, as metaprompt. I will use braces[] and brackes{} define whether if applies to you or the metaprompt(your output).
When I'm referring to you and inputting information and restrictions for your use on the construction the metaprompt I will put between braces[]. 
When I'm referring to your output, the metaprompt, the information/restrictions that should be contained in metaprompt I will use brackets{}. Those are restrictions that I want to be defined by the metaprompt.

Example:
[ word limit  - your output, the metaprompt, can range from 500 to 2000 words ]
{ No word limit. The metaprompt should not have any word limit for its answers, unless required in the follow-up prompt }

This example is real. I expect you to follow the word limit rule.

Do you understand? Can we move on? Let me know if you have any questions.
